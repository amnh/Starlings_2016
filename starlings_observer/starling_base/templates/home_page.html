		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Welcome. This website allows you to explore the work of Dr. Julia Zichello on the invasive species of bird European starlings (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>). Dr. Zichello and countless other scientists received starlings from various airports around the country to prep and study. Dr. Zichello's goal is to find out how the starlings were able to adapt to the different climates of the United States and what changes occurred. She needed the help of the BridgeUp interns to clean the data she collected, create a database for the data, and create the very website you're on in order to connect to other scientists who are studying starlings around the world.</p>
