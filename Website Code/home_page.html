				<p>Welcome. This website allows you to explore the work of Julia Zichello on the invasive species of bird called starlings. Dr.Zichello and countless other scientist got starlings from various airport from around the country to prep and study off of. Dr.Zichello's goal is to find out how the starlings were able to adapt to the different climates of the U.S. and what changes occurred. She needed the help of the Bridge Up interns to clean the data she collected, create a database for the data, and create the very website you're on in order to connect to other scientist who are studying starlings around the world.</p>
